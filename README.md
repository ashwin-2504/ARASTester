## 🚀 Why ARASTester?

Manual testing of ARAS PLM configurations is tedious, repetitive, and prone to human error. **ARASTester** changes the game.

Designed specifically for **ARAS PLM Testers** and **Configuration Developers**, this tool empowers you to build, organize, and execute complex test scenarios without writing a single line of code. Whether you're validating a new lifecycle map, checking permission models, or ensuring data integrity, ARASTester streamlines your workflow so you can focus on quality, not clicking.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🖱️ Visual Test Builder
Forget complex scripting. Build your test plans using a modern, intuitive **drag-and-drop interface**. Reorder tests, group actions, and modify parameters visually.

### 📂 Hierarchical Organization
Manage hundreds of test cases with ease. Our **nested test tree** allows you to structure your validation logic logically, just like your PLM data model.

### ⚡ Native Performance
Built on **Electron** and **React**, ARASTester delivers a native desktop experience. It's fast, responsive, and integrates seamlessly with your Windows environment.

### 🔒 Privacy First & Local Storage
Your data is yours. ARASTester stores all test plans as local **JSON files**. No cloud uploads, no external servers. You have full control over your testing IP.

### 🛠️ Extensible Action Registry
Need to click a button? Verify a field? Run a server method? Our **Action Registry** comes pre-loaded with essential ARAS interactions, and it's designed to grow with your needs.
